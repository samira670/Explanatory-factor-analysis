The Jupyter notebook demonstrates Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) using scikit-learn to reduce dimensionality and identify underlying factors in a dataset. It details the process of setting up the data for analysis, applying the FactorAnalysis method, and displaying the factor loadings, which illustrate the contribution of each original variable to the identified factors. This approach helps in simplifying complex data by extracting essential features that explain patterns in the data.
